A few of those features of the LetGo app and website include an in-app chat, ratings, reviews, integration with Facebook, Google and other platforms as well as image recognition. All the seller has to do is take a photo and the app recognizes what you're selling and automatically gives it a title and categorizes it. The in-app chat feature eliminates having to ask questions or negotiate via email. If the seller isn't online when a buyer asks a question, the seller will receive a notification. LetGo is free to download and use. 'LetGo doesn't take a cut of sales or charge sellers to list an item,' says Lowe. 'There's one paid feature to add extra visibility to your listing if you choose, but that's entirely optional and the cost is just a couple of dollars.'\r\n\r\n","author":"via itunes.apple.com","attribution":"via itunes.apple.com","hasSyndicationRights":"1"},"1":{"title":"When it turns out you're not musically inclined","url":"http:\/\/www.rd.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2017\/08\/02-Forget-Yard-Sales-Try-These-9-Easy-Ways-to-Sell-Your-Stuff-Online-via-itunes.apple_.com_.jpg","description":"\r\n\r\nDecided you're never going to master the bass guitar?

'When buyers and sellers call, email or chat Reverb, they not only get a real person on the other end—they get a musician.

Unlike some apps, these groups require approval from the page moderator. 'Typically, you need to be a neighborhood resident or within a certain distance from the neighborhood to join,' says Wenzke. To find a group near you, just type in 'yard sales near me' and a list of virtual yard sales in your area will pop up. Find the one you like and click the 'join' button. If you meet the groups criteria, you'll be accepted and can start posting. Read the rules carefully because every group is a bit different. 'It's important as a seller to be reasonable with your pricing. Negotiating over price happens less often with Facebook than with sites such as Craigslist, so keep that in mind when you list your item,' says Wenzke. Since you're dealing with neighbors and friends, reputations are a stake and it's less likely you'll have no-shows after a deal has been made.

'This is a concern because poor body image can have harmful implications for a woman's psychological and physical health including increased risk for low self-esteem, depression, and for eating disorders.' In her study, Martin Ginis compared the self-perceptions of a group of women who had completed 30 minutes of aerobic exercise with a group who had instead sat and read. The study found those who had exercised had 'significant improvements in their body image' over those who hadn't exercised. This effect was linked to the women in the exercise group perceiving themselves as being stronger and thinner. 'We all have those days when we don't feel great about our bodies,' Martin Ginis said, according to ScienceDaily. 'This study and our previous research shows one way to feel better, is to get going and exercise. The effects can be immediate.'

Suzuki, PhD, professor of Neural Science and Psychology in the Center for Neural Science at New York University, and principal investigator on a 2017 review in <em>Brain Plasticity.<\/em> Dr. Suzuki examined a wealth of scientific data on the range of changes one bout of exercise can achieve. For example, an enormous amount of research has shown one exercise session can enhance activity in the prefrontal cortex, a brain region that is home to executive function skills such as working memory and attention. While the reasons aren't yet proven, science has some guesses. First, a pair of neurochemicals used by the prefrontal cortex—dopamine and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)—both get a boost from a workout, and they're both tied to higher functioning in the brain. Second, exercise increases the blood's level of lactate, which is used throughout the brain—in particular by the prefrontal cortex—as energy. The third theory involves the finding that exercise detours blood away from the prefrontal cortex in order to supply the muscles working hard to run a lap or lift a weight. But after exercise, a compensatory surge of blood is rushed back to the prefrontal cortex, which could account for the hyped executive function skills observed after hitting the gym.\r\n\r\n","author":"Alex Mit\/Shutterstock","attribution":"Alex Mit\/Shutterstock","hasSyndicationRights":"1"},"3":{"title":"Improved mood","url":"http:\/\/www.rd.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2017\/07\/04_relaxed_Things-That-Happen-to-Your-Body-After-Just-One-Workout_266689532_Mila-Supinskaya-Glashchenko.jpg","description":"\r\n\r\nRegular exercise has been linked to a better outlook—along with these other <a href='http:\/\/www.rd.com\/health\/conditions\/overcoming-depression\/1'>proven mood-boosting strategies<\/a>.

The effects of exercise on stress is an area science is learning a lot about. Even a single session can trigger the release of cortisol, which then dampens the cortisol response that could later be triggered by other factors such as a public speaking engagement or a nerve-racking test. In addition, lessening stress can mean improving memory. Part of the reason you don't remember things well when anxious is that stress attacks the functioning of the hippocampus, a brain area critical to memory—but a single bout of exercise can help protect against that attack. All these neuro perks—from executive function enhancement to stress reduction—add up to make exercise an especially smart thing to do around the time of a challenging mental event.

'The old man the boat.'<\/strong>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBesides sounding like a rejected Ernest Hemingway title, this deceptive sentence is indeed grammatically correct thanks to some well-placed homonyms—multiple words that share the same spellings but have different meanings.

At first glance, you’d be right to think that 'raced' is the main verb of this sentence.  But it’s not. The simplest form of this sentence is actually, 'The horse fell'; confusingly, 'raced past the barn' is being used as a sort of adjective phrase to tell us which horse we’re talking about— was it the horse tethered behind the barn who fell, or the horse raced past the barn?\r\n\r\nOf course, this sentence would make way more sense if it was written 'The horse<strong> that was raced<\/strong> past the barn fell', but the quirks of English allow us to remove certain conjunctions like 'that' and still maintain meaning, the way you might say 'the person I love' instead of 'the person that I love.' Long story short, the horse fell (hopefully on top of whoever invented this sentence).\r\n\r\n","author":"Tatiana Ayazo\/Rd.com","attribution":"Tatiana Ayazo\/Rd.com","hasSyndicationRights":"1"},"3":{"url":"http:\/\/www.rd.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2017\/07\/03-Simple-Sentences-That-Drive-English-Speakers-Crazy.jpg","description":"\r\n\r\n<strong>3. 'The complex houses married and single soldiers and their families.'<\/strong>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSimilar to 'the old man the boat,' the trick of this sentence is figuring out which word is the verb, and which is the subject. At first, it seems like 'houses' is the subject and 'married' is the verb—then you get to 'and single,' realizing too late 'married and single soldiers' is a big adjective phrase. Even more confusing, 'complex' seems to be an adjective modifying 'houses,' which makes sense logically and linguistically to us. But it turns out 'complex' is meant as a noun here, as in an 'office complex' or 'sporting complex', and 'houses' is the verb, meaning 'to shelter.'\r\n\r\nSo, the non-confusing way to write this sentence would be: 'the building shelters married and single soldiers and their families.' Or, to cut out the redundancy, 'The building shelters soldiers and their families.' Basically, a needlessly complex way to describe on-base housing.\r\n\r\n","author":"Tatiana Ayazo\/Rd.com","attribution":"Tatiana Ayazo\/Rd.com","hasSyndicationRights":"1"},"4":{"url":"http:\/\/www.rd.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2017\/07\/04-Simple-Sentences-That-Drive-English-Speakers-Crazy.jpg","description":"\r\n\r\n<strong>4.

'Symptoms of anxiety disorder range around mood, cognitive, and physical symptoms,' explains Joel Sherrill, PhD, deputy director of the Division of Services and Intervention Research at the National Institute of Mental Health. The long list of symptoms include everything from feelings of restlessness or having difficulty concentrating to muscle tension, fatigue, and sleep problems. While people who have anxiety attacks often experience symptoms for months, they don't always realize they have anxiety. 'They seek treatment because they can't sleep or they get a massage or go to the doctor because they can't relax,' says <a href='https:\/\/anxietytreatmentcenter.com\/our-doctors\/dr-karen-cassiday\/' target='_blank'>Karen Cassiday,<\/a> PhD, ACT, President of the <a href='https:\/\/www.adaa.org\/' target='_blank'>Anxiety and Depression Association of America. <\/a>'Worry itself seems like the right thing to do so they don't seek help for the worry,' says Dr.Cassiday.\r\n\r\n'With panic, you have unexpected, sudden attacks of intense fear,' says Dr. Sherrill.

According to the <a style='background-color: initial' href='https:\/\/adaa.org\/' target='_blank'>Anxiety and Depression Association of America,<\/a> it's a normal biological reaction—the body's way of telling us that something isn't right—that prepares us to act quickly so we stay out of harm's way. Yet when anxiety becomes overwhelming and begins to interfere with our daily lives, it becomes <a style='background-color: initial' href='https:\/\/adaa.org\/understanding-anxiety'>anxiety disorder<\/a>.\r\n\r\nPanic attacks happen out of the blue and overwhelm with physical symptoms of a racing heart, nausea, trembling, and irregular pulse. 'It's traumatic,' says Dr. Cassiday, 'Like the feeling that you got as a kid when someone held you under the water too long—you feel like something terrible is happening.' Many people who experience a panic attack believe they are having a heart attack or stroke and misperceive it as being in imminent danger. 'They want to get help because it feels unusual, it doesn't make sense, and they will call their doctor or go to the emergency room,' says Cassiday.\r\n\r\nWith generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), people experience an attack of worry and experience symptoms of fatigue, restlessness, muscle tension, and sleep problems. 'They get caught up in the worse case scenario and they can't let go of it—what if I lose my job, what if my partner is having an affair, what if my child gets in a car accident,' says Cassiday. While the symptoms of panic attacks and anxiety attacks can be alarming, the most important thing to realize is that you are not in danger, she explains. 'You need to understand that it is a false alarm. Even though you think you are going insane, you are not--most panic attacks will peter out after two or three minutes.'\r\n\r\n","author":"crazystocker\/Shutterstock","attribution":"crazystocker\/Shutterstock","hasSyndicationRights":"1"},"3":{"title":"Breathe quietly and slowly","url":"http:\/\/www.rd.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2017\/07\/04-breathing-Tips-Will-Help-You-Understand-and-Manage-Anxiety-and-Panic-Disorder_427789492-Microgen.jpg","description":"\r\n\r\nPeople who suffer from anxiety and panic attacks often experience <a href='http:\/\/www.rd.com\/health\/conditions\/chest-pains-and-heart-attacks\/'>chest pains,<\/a> which are caused by hyperventilating and tight muscles in the chest, explains Cassiday. 'They go to the emergency room hyperventilating, holding their chest and belly—they are so tight that they forget to breathe.' While the episode can be scary, it's important not to tell the person suffering the panic attack to 'take a deep breath,' says Cassiday. 'You don't want them to over inhale carbon dioxide.' Instead, if you are hyperventilating, <a href='https:\/\/www.anxietybc.com\/sites\/default\/files\/CalmBreathing.pdf' target='_blank'>breathe calmly<\/a>. Close your mouth and breathe quietly through your nose, gently, and as slowly as possible to restore carbon dioxide levels—that will make you feel better, says Cassiday.

In addition to making you feel more anxious, sleep deprivation creates an imbalance in hormone levels and increases adrenaline levels, and both can increase anxiety.

People who experience panic attacks may start avoiding certain situations because they fear it will bring on a panic attack.

(<a href='http:\/\/www.rd.com\/health\/healthy-eating\/obesity-prevention-begins-with-the-bottle\/'>Does obesity prevention begin with the bottle?<\/a>) Excess weight can increase a child's risk factors for type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and some forms of cancer, says Maryam Kebbe, a <a href='https:\/\/www.sciencedaily.com\/releases\/2017\/07\/170706143151.htm' target='_blank'>researcher<\/a> on children with obesity at the University of Alberta in Canada. At the same time, eating disorders and body positivity have become important topics for today's youth. So if your child is overweight, how can you address it with them? First, focus on health, not weight. 'It's a common mistake to focus on the weight itself—this is usually counterproductive,' says Elizabeth Shepard, MD, pediatrician, nutrition, and obesity specialist at <a href='http:\/\/www.stanfordchildrens.org\/en\/service\/pediatric-weight\/program\/overview' target='_blank'>Stanford Children's Health<\/a>. 'The focus should be on action, i.e. incorporating lifestyle changes that lead to the desired outcome of a healthier weight.' For example, try talking about the amazing things healthy foods can do for the body, like give you energy to run, jump, and play—so when you start serving them, there'll be a positive association.\r\n\r\n","author":"Tiwat K\/Shutterstock","attribution":"Tiwat K\/Shutterstock","hasSyndicationRights":"1"},"1":{"title":"Don't mention 'dieting'","url":"http:\/\/www.rd.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2017\/07\/06_health_Smart-Ways-to-Talk-to-Kids-About-Their-Weight_569018641_Tiwat-K.jpg","description":"\r\n\r\nEating healthy isn't 'dieting,' so avoid using that word.  'Changes have to be sustainable over the long term to be effective,' Dr. Shepard says. 'Making changes in food is not 'going on a diet.'' Stress that new foods will be delicious, and try some out until you find healthier options your child truly enjoys—this way, they are part of the decision-making process, too. Because you're making changes as a family, your child won't feel singled out or shamed for what they can or can't eat. In addition, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) <a href='http:\/\/pediatrics.aappublications.org\/content\/early\/2016\/08\/18\/peds.2016-1649' target='_blank'>notes<\/a> that research shows dieting (defined as calorie restriction with a goal of weight loss) is actually a risk factor for both obesity and eating disorders among teenagers.

For younger children, it might not be necessary to even explain why changes are being made—instead, just do it. For older children, it's a little trickier, especially if they bring it up. 'Psychological and emotional concerns are very common in children with excess weight,' Kebbe says. 'Many boys and girls experience weight-based teasing and bullying, which often have a negative impact in their lives.' Before deciding whether to address it directly, gather details about whether your child is actually concerned about their weight. If they're not, gentle lifestyle switches may be the better than a direct discussion about weight, which might affect their self-confidence.\r\n\r\n","author":"Tiwat K\/Shutterstock","attribution":"Tiwat K\/Shutterstock","hasSyndicationRights":"1"},"3":{"title":"Consider your kid's opinion","url":"http:\/\/www.rd.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2017\/07\/04_health_Smart-Ways-to-Talk-to-Kids-About-Their-Weight_569018641_Tiwat-K.jpg","description":"\r\n\r\nIf your child is older and expresses interest in talking about their weight, ask them for their preferred word choices. 'Recent research with teenagers showed that they liked 'heavy' for boys and 'curvy' for girls,' says Geoff Ball, PhD, an assistant professor at the University of Alberta and the director of the Pediatric Center for Weight and Health at Stollery Children's Hospital in Edmonton, Canada. Don't use words like 'obese' or 'fat,' and maintain sensitivity and respect by asking your child's opinion on everything—including the changes that will be made. 'When talking with children, it's key to be conscious of the language used, talk about weight and possible lifestyle changes in a sensitive manner, and respect children's readiness to change,' Kebbe says. 'Forcing change on someone else when he or she isn't ready can have the exact opposite effect.' Instead, ask them how <em>they<\/em> feel about it and what <em>they<\/em> think their goals should be, and let them know they have your full support.

'Sometimes these changes are big, but sometimes they're small—they can include, for example, eating dinner together as a family, and including children in buying and preparing food,' he says.
